                    The <b>Machinery Business Management System</b> is a
                    comprehensive web-based platform designed to streamline the
                    operations of machinery businesses by providing a seamless
                    experience for both owners and customers. It allows business
                    owners to showcase their machinery products online, manage
                    categories, and efficiently handle customer orders. The
                    system features a secure payment integration where customers
                    can place orders and complete transactions via NEFT or other
                    methods. Additionally, it includes a delivery and service
                    management module to track order fulfillment and post-sale
                    services. An intuitive <b>admin dashboard</b> enables
                    businesses to manage users, orders, payments, and customer
                    feedback with ease. To enhance decision-making, the platform
                    also provides <b>dynamic reports</b>, allowing admins to
                    generate and export essential business data in formats like
                    <b>PDF and CSV</b>. Built using <b>React.js</b> for the frontend,
                    <b>Node.js and Express.js</b> for the backend, and <b>MySQL</b>
                    for data management, the system is designed for scalability
                    and efficiency. With secure user authentication, including
                    email verification and password reset functionality, this
                    solution ensures a reliable and user-friendly experience for
                    businesses looking to enhance their online presence and
                    operational workflow. ðŸš€ (But I have not hosted the backend, so it won't show products, and you cannot perform any operations in the site.)
